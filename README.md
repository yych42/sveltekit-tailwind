# SvelteKit-Tailwind Template

This minimum template is based on the Skeleton app you would get by running `npm init svelte@next your-app`.

Differences:
- Tailwind will be installed and ready (configured) when you run `npm install` for the first time.
- The default git branch is `development` instead of `master`.
